# Freddy's Portfolio

Create a intuitive, light-weight project that introduce me. Come and take a look inside.

### Project tech base
- React
- Vite (My first project with Vite bundling and hold entries for me)
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS (Oh man! This stuff is gorgeous!)
- eslint with airbnb configuration
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) (This is much more convenient than the original Redux structure)
- [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)

### Why update the former version
The former version of my protfolio is produced when I first try to join the Front End Development world. The tech used in this project might be a little bit outdated. Most Important, I want to record some of my own tech notes into this project, and this needs a huge refactor of the old one.

Hope enjoy the journey within this beautiful site. Happy coding!
